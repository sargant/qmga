Requirements include:
- glut development library, e.g. freeglut-devel
- qt library version 3 (plus headers, e.g. qt-devel)
- a decent driver for your graphics card adapter 
  (if the program is very slow even with small systems, 
  this is probably the reason).

Installation instructions:
- change into the directory of the source code (e.g. qmga)
- type qmake
- a Makefile should be created by Qt
- type make
(- hope that no errors occur)
- type ./qmga
